# Policies on forking repositories and maintaining forks

## Summary

* You can fork any public repository, as long as you keep the `LICENSE` file intact and (optionally) configured the Pull app (by creating `.github/pull.yml`).
* You can't fork any of private repositories The Pins Team belongs to, unless you have an permission from an team member.
  * If your private repositories are on here, we'll asked you to move it to your presonal account.
  * By default, we globally disabled forking of private repos, unless overriden by indivual repos.
  * Forking any private repos outside the team onto here isn't allowed.
* If you fork an repo using `git push` way (e.g. Vercel doesn't fork the repo), copy the upstream repo link as website and CLEARLY state that you forked that using the `git push`
way on the repo description.

## Fork Maintanance

It's an shared reposibility to maintain forks that fall in our GitHub/GitLab groups/orgs. If you can't maintain it, you can either:
* transfer maintainer/admin right to someone else
* archive it
* delete it (not recommended)
