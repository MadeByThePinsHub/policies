# The Pins Team's Org Policies

This repo contains our global Code of Conduct for both participation of activites in our open-source projects and for interacting with each other
in both public spaces for the community and internal spaces for core team members/employees and community maintainers/team members, among other things,
including our org-wide Security Policy.

## Table of Contents

* [Org-wide Code of Conduct for Communication and Contribution/Participation](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   * We don't have an CoC for events and other stuff outside of the default CoC for open-source/internal projects 
* [Org-wide VDP/Security Policy](SECURITY.md) - Includes systems in and out of scope across our properties.
   * Currently, there's no monentary rewards for these, but we'll thank you for helping make the Internet and opem-source software supply chain more secure.
   * We'll also provide templates for use in individual projects we maintain in the foreseeable future.

### File mapping for handbook site building

We use an script to map these files and directories in this repo into paths compartible into [our handbook website][handbook], using
[this script](./file-mapper.sh) during build time before the main `mkdocs build` starts, usually on scheduled/manual basis. While they
may be commitied there, our bots will check the PRs if you changed these and reminded them to revert these. Even through ourselves might
commit these changes on the handbook side, these are overwritten on next run.
