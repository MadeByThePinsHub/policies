# The Pins Team OSS Projects Maintainership Policies

This repository contains all policies regarding how to maintain our OSS projects for both 
CHN Board members and team members. We'll update the documentations as more stuff arises.

## File and Directory Mapping to the handbook website

We use an script to map these files and directories in this repo
into paths compartible into [our handbook website][handbook], using
[this script](./file-mapper.sh) during build time afer cloning this repo
as an Git submodule.

* This file (the root `README.md`) will turn into `handbook-src/community-hub/oss-policies/index.md`
* Security policy (`SECURITY.md`) will turn into `handbook-src/community-hub/oss-policies/oss-security.md`
* Our Community Code of Conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD`) will also turn into `handbook-src/community-hub/oss-policies/code-of-conduct.md`
  * That CCoC page will also receive redirects from `/code-of-conduct` when accessed on our website,
whenever it's the production-grade one on GitLab Pages/Render/GitHub Pages or from your local/cloud dev
environment running `mkdocs serve`.
